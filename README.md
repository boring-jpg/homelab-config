# Ansible

Set of Ansible playbooks to manage my home server setup, which includes a three-node Proxmox cluster and a NAS.

This collection also controls a reverse proxy and containers for services like DNS, VPN, media streaming, and file sharing. The playbooks handle user management and basic security features, making everything easier to run and maintain
